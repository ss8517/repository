This is a numerical solver to the widely known Lid Driven Cavity problem of fluid mechanics. This provides a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations by eliminating pressure from the equation and tranforming it into a problem of corticity and stream function. 

The Makefile runs the parallel version of the solver through main by compiling the classes. 

The serial version of the solver is called iterationtest.cpp. (E.g. Run in Linux by linking against LDLIBS=-llapack -lcblas -lblas -lgfortran)
